"""
    descendants(node::Node,key,<keyword arguments>)

Get attribute values from the descendants (acropetal).

# Arguments

## Mandatory arguments

- `node::Node`: The node to start at.
- `key`: The key, or attribute name. Make it a `Symbol` for faster computation time.

## Keyword Arguments

- `scale = nothing`: The scale to filter-in (i.e. to keep). Usually a Tuple-alike of integers.
- `symbol = nothing`: The symbol to filter-in. Usually a Tuple-alike of Strings.
- `link = nothing`: The link with the previous node to filter-in. Usually a Tuple-alike of Char.
- `all::Bool = true`: Return all filtered-in nodes (`true`), or stop at the first node that
is filtered out (`false`).
- `self = false`: is the value for the current node needed ?
- `filter_fun = nothing`: Any filtering function taking a node as input, e.g. [`isleaf`](@ref).
- `type::Union{Union,DataType}`: The type of the attribute. Makes the function run much
faster if provided (â‰ˆ4x faster).

# Note

In most cases, the `type` argument should be given as a union of `Nothing` and the data type
of the attribute to manage missing or inexistant data, e.g. measurements made at one scale
only. See examples for more details.

# Examples

```julia
# Importing the mtg from the github repo:
mtg = read_mtg(download("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VEZY/MTG.jl/master/test/files/simple_plant.mtg"))

descendants(mtg, :Length) # Short to write, but slower to execute

# Fast version, note that we pass a union of Nothing and Float64 because there are some nodes
# without a `Length` attribute:
descendants(mtg, :Length, type = Union{Nothing,Float64})

# Filter by scale:
descendants(mtg, :XX, scale = 1, type = Float64)
descendants(mtg, :Length, scale = 3, type = Float64)

# Filter by symbol:
descendants(mtg, :Length, symbol = "Leaf")
descendants(mtg, :Length, symbol = ("Leaf","Internode"))
```
